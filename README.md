# Spatial Audio & AI

## Overview

This repository contains several Python modules that form a toolkit for audio processing, spatial sound control, server integration, and diffusion-based sound generation. It is designed to help developers work with spatial audio, process sound streams, and generate new audio using modern techniques. The key components include playback control, sound spatialization, server functionality, and stable audio diffusion.

## Features

Playback Stream: Module for managing playback streams and audio processing (playback_stream.py).

Server Integration: Server module that allows interaction with sound systems via APIs (server.py).

Sound System: A framework for controlling sound output, with support for multiple speakers (sound_system.py).

Spatializer: Spatial sound control for multi-speaker systems (spatializer.py).

Tools: Helper functions for audio manipulation, effects like fade-in and fade-out (tools.py).

Stable Audio Diffusion: Generate creative audio clips using text prompts (stable_audio.py).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

``` bash
python -m pip install requirements.txt
```
